Important Note:
[These are the same instructions provided in the ch16_webservices readme file.]
Before running these applications, you must perform the following steps 
(detailed instructions follow).
	**Start the JavaDB Database Server.
	**Create the database.
	**Populate the database with data.
	**Start GlassFish server.
	**Deploy the SmartPhoneDataServer (this is the RESTful web services application).


Steps to start the JavaDB server.

1. In the NetBeans IDE, click the Services Tab.
2. Expand the Databases node, right click on Java DB, and select Start Server.

Steps to create the database.

1. After the Server starts up, right click on Java DB, and select Create Database â€¦.
2. In the Create Java DB Database dialog, specify phonedata for all fields 
(database name, user name, password, and confirm password) and click OK.

Steps to populate the database with data.

1. In the NetBeans IDE, File | Open SmartPhoneDataSales.sql, which is found in this directory.
2. In the SQL Editor window, click the Connection drop down 
and select phonedata to connect to the phonedata database.
3. In the SQL Editor window, click the Run SQL icon to execute the SQL file.

The file creates the Salesdata and Company tables and populates them with data. 
You can disregard any 'DROP TABLE' errors.
You can re-execute this SQL to restore the data and the 'DROP TABLE' errors will no longer appear.

Steps to start the GlassFish server.

These projects use Java EE technologies and a bundled server (GlassFish), 
optionally included with the NetBeans IDE. 
Download and install these technologies if your configuration does not include them. 
You can add them using the IDE's Plugin Manager (Tools | Plugins).

(When you deploy project SmartPhoneDataServer, the GlassFish server will automatically start.)

1. In the NetBeans IDE, click the Services Tab.
2. Expand the Serviers node. Add GlassFish, if not listed.
3. Right click on GlashFish and select Start Server.
