Projects:
Version1-CRUDActions/FamilyTreeApp
Version2-UsingJavaDB-andJPA/FamilyTreeApp
Version3-Concurrency/FamilyTreeApp

Important Note:
Version2-UsingJavaDB-andJPA/FamilyTreeApp and Version3-Concurrency/FamilyTreeApp 
use EclipseLink and JavaDB for persistence. 

Before running these applications, you must start the JavaDB Database Server.
Before running the application the first time, you must create the database.

Follow these steps to start the server.

1. In the NetBeans IDE, click the Services Tab.
2. Expand the Databases node, right click on Java DB, and select Start Server.

Follow these steps to create the database.

1. After the Server starts up, right click on Java DB, and select Create Database â€¦.
2. In the Create Java DB Database dialog, 
specify personftm for all fields 
(database name, user name, password, and confirm password) 
and click OK.

After you run the FamilyTreeApp the first time, 
the database tables will be created as well as the Simpson Family test data.

You can modify the persistence.xml file in module 
FamilyTreeManagerJPA so that the tables aren't re-created each time. 
Use "create-tables" or "none".
