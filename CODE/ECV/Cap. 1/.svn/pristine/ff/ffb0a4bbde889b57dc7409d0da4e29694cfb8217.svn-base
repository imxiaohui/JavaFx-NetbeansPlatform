FamilyTreeApp Reference Application

Additional documentation about this project is available at
www.asgteach.com/NetBeansPlatformBook/FamilyTreeApp.

The application uses a local database (JavaDB). You must start the database server and
create the "familytree" database, as follows:


1. Start the JavaDB database server: From Services | Databases | JavaDB, 
   right-click and select Start Server (if not already started). 

2. Create the familytree database. Note: Only create the database Once.
   Right-click and select Create Database. In the dialog, 
   use 'familytree' (lowercase) for all fields: 

- Database Name: familytree

- User Name: familytree

- Password: familytree

Click OK.

3. Open the FamilyTreeApp in NetBeans IDE. In the Projects window,
   right-click on project FamilyTreeApp, 
   and then choose "Run".

NOTE: There is no initialization SQL script. The database is configured 
via the persistence unit and the entity classes. 

The data is initialized in the DataInstaller @OnStart Runnable class in module
FamilyTreeModel. 
Note that the data is re-initialized each time you run the application.

See below for options on retaining the data or having no initial data. 

***If you want to retain modified data in between runs of the application, make
the following modifications:

1. In the FamilyTreeModel module, 
comment out the call to populateDatabase() in the DataInstaller run() method.

2. In the FamilyTreeDAOJPAProvider module, in file META-INF/persistence.xml, 
under General, change the Table Generation Strategy to None.

***If you want to use a cleanly-initialized database with NO DATA:

1. In the FamilyTreeModel module, 
comment out the call to populateDatabase() in the DataInstaller run() method.

2. In the FamilyTreeDAOJPAProvider module, in file META-INF.persistence.xml, 
under General, keep the Table Generation Strategy as Drop and Create.

3. Before running the FamilyTree App again, in order to retain any data you created, 
in the FamilyTreeDAOJPAProvider module, in file META-INF.persistence.xml, 
under General, change the Table Generation strategy to None.

***If you want to use Nimbus Look and Feel:

Add:

run.args.extra=--laf Nimbus

to the NetBeans Platform Config file under FamilyTreeApp | Important Files
